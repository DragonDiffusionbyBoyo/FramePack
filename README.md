🐉🔥 Welcome to FramePack — Forked off lllyasviel but then Powered by Dragon Diffusion UK 🔥🐉

Prepare to ride the dragons of AI animation!
Before you unleash the beast, please follow these instructions carefully:
⚙️ Step 1: Install CUDA 12.4 Manually

This installer does not install CUDA for you.
You must install CUDA Toolkit 12.4 yourself before running anything.

👉 Download it here: NVIDIA CUDA 12.4 Toolkit

Make sure:

    Install the CUDA Toolkit only (you don't need all the extras like Nsight).

    Reboot your machine if asked.

🛠 Step 2: Run Install.bat

Once CUDA 12.4 is installed, double-click Install.bat.

The dragons will handle:

    Checking and installing Git

    Checking and installing Python 3.10

    Checking and installing Visual Studio Build Tools

    Cloning this repo automatically

    Setting up a Python virtual environment

    Installing Triton and SageAttention wheels

    Summoning a final magic file: run.bat

🛡 Important:
You may see admin permission popups during installation — say YES to allow the dragons to work their magic.
🚀 Step 3: Launch FramePack

After installation is complete, you’ll find a new file:

🟢 run.bat

Double-click run.bat to launch FramePack and enter the Dragon’s Den of AI frame generation!
🐲 Good luck, brave adventurer.
