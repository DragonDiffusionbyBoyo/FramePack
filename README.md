🐉 Prerequisites: Install Python 3.10.11
Before running the FramePack installer, you must manually install Python 3.10.11. This ensures compatibility with the dragons of AI animation.
👉 Steps to install Python 3.10.11:

Download the Python 3.10.11 installer from the official Python website:
Python 3.10.11 Downloads
Choose the Windows Installer (64-bit) for most systems.


Run the installer and ensure you:
Check "Add Python 3.10 to PATH" during installation.
Select "Install for all users" if prompted (requires admin permissions).


Verify the installation by opening a command prompt and running:python --version

It should display Python 3.10.11.
If you have multiple Python versions, ensure Python 3.10.11 is accessible via:py -3.10 --version



⚠️ Important: FramePack requires Python 3.10.11 specifically. Other versions may cause compatibility issues.

Prepare to ride the dragons of AI animation!
Before you unleash the beast, please follow these instructions carefully:
⚙️ Step 1: Install CUDA 12.4 Manually

This installer does not install CUDA for you.
You must install CUDA Toolkit 12.4 yourself before running anything.

👉 Download it here: NVIDIA CUDA 12.4 Toolkit

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive

Make sure:

    Install the CUDA Toolkit only (you don't need all the extras like Nsight).

    Reboot your machine if asked.

🛠 Step 2: Run Install.bat

Once CUDA 12.4 is installed, double-click Install.bat.

The dragons will handle:

    Checking and installing Git

    Checking and installing Python 3.10

    Checking and installing Visual Studio Build Tools

    Cloning this repo automatically

    Setting up a Python virtual environment

    Installing Triton and SageAttention wheels

    Summoning a final magic file: run.bat

🛡 Important:
You may see admin permission popups during installation — say YES to allow the dragons to work their magic.
🚀 Step 3: Launch FramePack

After installation is complete, you’ll find a new file:

🟢 Run_FramePack.bat

Double-click run.bat to launch FramePack and enter the Dragon’s Den of AI frame generation!
🐲 Good luck, brave adventurer.
